Hi, I'm Israel Diaz — a driven and adaptable professional with a strong background in hospitality, sales management, and team leadership. Over the past several years, I’ve worked in the hotel industry, where I led high-performing teams, developed strategic sales initiatives, and used market data to drive revenue growth. My experience has taught me the value of customer insight, data-driven decision-making, and cross-functional collaboration.

As I’ve grown in my career, I’ve expanded my skillset into the world of data analytics and tech. I enjoy using tools and platforms to turn complex data into clear, actionable insights that help teams make better decisions and deliver results.

🛠️ Tech Skills
Data & Analytics: SQL, Excel, R, Python

Data Visualization: Tableau, Power BI

Creative & Productivity Tools: Adobe Suite, Google Workspace

🌎 A Little More About Me
Outside of work, I’m passionate about staying active, exploring the outdoors, and continuously learning. Whether it’s picking up a new hobby, traveling to a new city, or diving into a side project, I’m always looking for ways to grow both personally and professionally.

I’m actively looking to collaborate on outsourcing projects, and I’m also open to relocation opportunities.
